Since the title implied "Easy Cipher", i've tried out Rot13 and i got the following text:
```
ROT XIII is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter XIII letters after it in the alphabet. ROT XIII is an example of the Caesar cipher, developed in ancient Rome. Flag is FLAGSwzgxBJSAMqwxxAU. Insert an underscore immediately after FLAG.
```

Based on the returned results, the key is ```FLAG_SwzgxBJSAMqwxxAU```
